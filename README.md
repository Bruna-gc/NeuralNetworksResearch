*Research project at the University of Indianapolis during the summer.*

I worked with Professor of Physics Dr.Joglekar on creating and analyzing Hopfield Networks.
This project investigates the behavior of Hopfield Networks, a class of artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms capable of storing and retrieving binary memory patterns through associative recall.
